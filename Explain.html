  <h1 align="center">The diffrence between block and inline elements</h1>
  <h2> Block elements are the elements that could not be aligned to each other such <span style="color: red;"> address, 
    blockquote, and the headings.</span> This is because block elemets occuipy the full screen's width</h2>

    <h3><em>For example:</em></h3>

<address>Beirut lebanon: 128 street</address> 
<blockquote>The blockquote element is used to indicate the quotation of a large section of text
   from another source. Using the default HTML styling of most web browsers, it will indent the
    right and left margins both on the display and in printed form, but this may be overridden 
    by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</blockquote>
<h4>The HTML h1–h6 elements represent six levels of section headings. 
  h1 is the highest section level and h6 is the lowest.</h4>   

  <h2> Inline elements are the elements that could be aligned to each other such as <span style="color: red;">link, 
    textarea, and button.</span> The reason for this is that they only takes up as much width as 
    necessary</h2>

    <h3><em>For example:</em></h3>

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">w3schools</a>
    <textarea></textarea>
    <button>Click here</button>

    <h1 align="center">The diffrence between class and ID</h1>
    <ul style="list-style: disk;"></ul>
    <li> A class selector is a full stop (“.”). </li>
    <li> An ID selector is a hash character (“#”). </li>
    <br><br>
    <li> A class can be used to identify more than one element.</li>
    <li> An ID can be used to identify one element only.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li> Same element could have more than one class.</li>
    <li> Same element could not have more than one ID.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li> Class is not higly sensitive.</li>
    <li> ID is higly sensitive.</li>
    <br><br>
    <li> Classes can overwrite each other i.e second class can overwrite the first class.</li>
    <li> ID can overwrite the class.</li>
